Elevator Pitch:

Have you ever wondered what your BAC is when youâ€™re drinking? Whether it be just out of curiosity or to see if you are safe enough to drive, our app is the go to. Using a reader that plugs into the Lightning adapter on your iPhone, our app will display your BAC and will also have information on what your BAC level means. You can customize the app with your height, weight, and tolerance level as well as view your history.
